# INFO
Here is the images folder. Lots of these images are taken from Google, and some are taken from personal photos I've taken of different things such as cybertrucks and the sort.

Something to note is that trucks aren't treated as pick-up trucks they are treated as 18-wheelers or cement trucks. Keep that in mind because "pickup trucks" are located in the car folder in the project.
